# RegUp
Developed this application as a final year project of my graduation. This app is specifically built for **Bangladesh University of Business and Technology**. The intent of building this application is to digitalize the course submission procedure for students and for faculties to view and save those submitted data. Functonalities of this app now works only for the department of **Computer Science and Engineering**. Did not get enough time to collect data from other departments. This app is integrated with **Firebase Authentication** and **Firebase Cloud Storage**. An **API** is used to verify the students of **BUBT**.
